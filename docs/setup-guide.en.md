# Cube Scrambler Setup Guide

## What to prepare

* M5Stack devices
	* We have tested with ATOMS3 Lite, ATOMS3, ATOM Lite, ATOM Matrix, M5Stack Core2, M5Stack, and M5StickC
	* [ATOMS3 Lite](https://www.switch-science.com/products/8778) is inexpensive and recommended
* [GeekServo 9G Servo-Gray](https://www.switch-science.com/products/6811) x 2
	* Gray 270Â° servo motor type
	* You will need two of them
	* Note that the red and orange ones are different
* [GROVE - 2-branch cable for servo](https://www.switch-science.com/products/1250)
	* Not required, but it will make the wiring cleaner
	* If not available, use a breadboard or jumper wires
* USB Type-C cable
* PC
	* Windows / Mac / Linux is OK
		* Android (Termux) also works
	* Node.js v18 or higher must be installed
* Cube
	* I think it doesn't work well if the rotation is heavy
	* I used Tornado V3 [Pioneer](https://store.tribox.com/products/detail.php?product_id=3499) model and [Flagship](https://store.tribox.com/products/detail.php?product_id=3498) models
		* It takes a little longer to arrive, but you can buy them cheaper on [AliExpress](https://ja.aliexpress.com/item/1005005486209524.html)

## Setup M5Stack device

### Installing opniz CLI

Install [opniz CLI](https://github.com/miso-develop/opniz-cli) from npm.  
opniz CLI is a tool to easily write opniz Arduino Library template sketches to M5Stack devices.  

```
npm install -g opniz-cli
```

\* *The installation of opniz CLI will take a few minutes because it downloads the Arduino CLI executable and builds the ESP32 environment.*  

### Writing to M5Stack device

Set up the M5Stack device using the opniz CLI.  

Connect the M5Stack device to your PC with a USB cable.  
Then, run the following command and enter the necessary information in interactive mode.  

```
npx opniz upload
```

The information required here is as follows.  

* The serial port of the device
* SSID / password of the Wi-Fi that the M5Stack device will connect to
* IP address of the PC running the Node.js application
* Type of M5Stack device to be written
* opniz communication port number (default is 3000)

Of these, all but the Wi-Fi password are automatically retrieved and displayed in the list, so simply select them.  
The opniz communication port number should be left at the default of 3000 and press enter.

\* *GIF images are written immediately, but the actual compile/write process takes about 10 minutes.*  



<br>

When the write is complete, the M5Stack device setup is complete.  

<br>



## Set up a Node.js application

### Clone the repository

Execute a `git clone` of the Cube Scrambler repository.  

```
git clone https://github.com/miso-develop/cube-scrambler && cd cube-scrambler
```

\* *If you do not have git installed, go to [the GitHub page of Cube Scrambler](https://github.com/miso-develop/cube-scrambler) and select `Download ZIP` from the green button marked `<> Code` to download and unzip the repository.*  

### Install dependent packages and build the application

The following command will install the dependent packages and build the application.  

```
npm install
```

<br>



## Calibration of GeekServo

\* *Be sure to calibrate GeekServo before assembling the LEGO robot!*  

First, connect the M5Stack device to GeekServo.  
If you have the "[GROVE - 2-branch cable for servos](https://www.switch-science.com/products/1250)", simply connect it to the Grove port on the M5Stack device.  

If you do not have [GROVE - 2-branch cable for servos], use a breadboard or jumper wire to connect the appropriate pin on the M5Stack device to the GeekServo.  
At this time, change the `STAND_SERVO_PIN` and `ARM_SERVE_PIN` in `config.ts` to the pin numbers connected to the M5Stack device.  

After connecting the M5Stack device and GeekServo, execute the following command.  

```
npm run calibration
```

If GeekServo's axis moves and the message `Calibration complete!` is displayed, it is a success.  

<br>



## Assembling a LEGO robot

Please refer to the linked PDF and assemble your LEGO robot.  

### [âž¡ How to assemble a LEGO robot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LfaUZmzZbCQRWulfV_bqecyGe_8wCMht/view)

<br>



## Run the application

Execute the following command to start the application.  

```
npm start
```

If you see `Device connected!`, you have successfully connected to the M5Stack device.  

### Accessing the Web UI

The web server for the Web UI is started at the same time the application is executed.  
Please access `http://localhost:3001` from your browser on your PC.  
The Web UI will be displayed.  

By setting the `localhost` part of `http://localhost:3001` to the IP address of your PC, you can access it from other terminals on the same network.  
For example, if your PC and smartphone are connected to the same network, you can access the Web UI from your smartphone.  

<br>

Then, try to control the LEGO robot from the Web UI.  
Have a good Cube LifeðŸ˜Ž

## When the movement is not stable
If the cube does not rotate vertically or falls off the stand, adjust the servo motor motion in the `config.ts` file.  

You can adjust the arm movement with `ARM_PULL_ANGLE`, `ARM_HOLD_ANGLE`, and `ARM_RELEASE_ANGLE`.  
Increasing the values of `ARM_PULL_SLEEP_MSEC` and `SERVO_TURN_SLEEP_MSEC` will slow down the movement slightly but make it more stable.  

```ts: config.ts
	ARM_PULL_ANGLE: 173, // Fine-tune the angle of the arm-side servomotor here
	ARM_HOLD_ANGLE: 220, // Fine-tune the angle of the arm-side servomotor here
	ARM_RELEASE_ANGLE: 237, // Fine-tune the angle of the arm-side servomotor here
	ARM_READY_ANGLE: 270, // Fine-tune the angle of the arm-side servomotor here
	
	ARM_PULL_SLEEP_MSEC: 250, // Arm sleep
	// ARM_PULL_SLEEP_MSEC: 350, // Use this if arm operation is unstable (e.g., heavy network environment)
	
	SERVO_TURN_SLEEP_MSEC: 250, // Stand and arm common sleep
	// SERVO_TURN_SLEEP_MSEC: 350, // Use this if motor operation is unstable (e.g., heavy network environment)
```
